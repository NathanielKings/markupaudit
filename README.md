# MarkupAudit

Audit HTML structure and accessibility against modern web standards.

MarkupAudit is a lightweight tool that evaluates HTML markup and highlights
semantic, structural, and accessibility issues using clear, human-readable
reports.

---

## Why MarkupAudit Exists

Modern developers increasingly rely on AI tools to generate HTML. While this
accelerates development, the resulting markup is often visually correct but
structurally flawed or inaccessible.

MarkupAudit helps developers review and improve HTML quality by identifying
issues related to semantic structure, accessibility, and markup hygiene.

---

## What It Checks

- Semantic HTML structure
- Heading hierarchy
- Landmark elements (`main`, `nav`, `header`, `footer`)
- Form accessibility issues
- WCAG-aligned warnings

---

## How It Works

1. Paste HTML or upload a file
2. Run the audit
3. Review a human-readable report

---

## Example Audit

- [Sample HTML Input](docs/sample-input.html)
- [Sample Audit Report](docs/sample-report.md)

## Live Demo

Deployment coming soon.

---

## Accessibility & Standards

MarkupAudit is built with web standards in mind and aligns its checks with WCAG
principles and semantic HTML best practices.

---

## Roadmap
